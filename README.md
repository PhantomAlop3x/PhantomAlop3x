# Hi there
You just stumbled upon my GitHub profile, likely by pure chance. I suppose I have to introduce myself.

I am PhantomAlop3x, but you can just call me Phantom (⁠◍⁠•⁠ᴗ⁠•⁠◍⁠). Before we start do you want a fun fact, well the Alopex part of my name derives from the genus type of an arctic fox... the more you know.

<sub><sup>Warning! This page is pure 24K fox adoration.</sup></sub>

## What do I do?
I taught myself UI (and to an extend UX) design originally starting in PowerPoint of all software, but eventually I leaped forward and arrived at figma for my conceptual work and webdev for making my concepts actually come to life!

On the complete flip-side, I have also gotten really into game development. For now I am working on Roblox, but I am learning Game Development in formal education to take it further.

<sub><sup>Did you know there are 12 types **true** foxes, these are part of the vulpes genus!</sup></sub>
